        <p class="naslov0"> Jennifer Lynn Barnes (who mostly goes by Jen) was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
            She has been, in turn, a competitive cheerleader, a volleyball player, a dancer, a debutante, a primate cognition researcher, 
            a teen model, a comic book geek, and a lemur aficionado. 
            She's been writing for as long as she can remember, finished her first full book 
            (which she now refers to as a "practice book" and which none of you will ever see) when she was still in high school, 
            and then wrote Golden the summer after her freshman year in college, when she was nineteen.

            Jen graduated high school in 2002, and from Yale University with a degree in cognitive science 
            (the study of the brain and thought) in May of 2006. She'll be spending the 2006-2007 school year abroad, 
            doing autism research at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.</p>

    <p class="book11">Avery Grambs has a plan for a better future: survive high school, win a scholarship, and get out. 
        When billionaire Tobias Hawthorne leaves Avery his fortune, she has no idea why. 
        To receive her inheritance, Avery must move into sprawling Hawthorne House,
         where every room bears the old man's touch - and his love of puzzles, riddles, and codes.
        Hawthorne House is also occupied by the four Hawthorne Grandsons: magnetic, brilliant boys. 
        Heir apparent Grayson Hawthorne is convinced Avery must be a conwoman. 
        Jameson views her as their Grandfather's last hurrah: a riddle to be solved. In a world of wealth and privilege, 
        Avery will have to play the game to survive.</p>

    <h2 class="naslov">The Hawthorne Legacy</h2>
    <p class="book11">The Inheritance Games ended with a bombshell, 
        and now heiress Avery Grambs has to pick up the pieces and find the man who might hold the answers to all of her questions
         - including why Tobias Hawthorne left his entire fortune to Avery, a virtual stranger, 
         rather than to his own daughters or grandsons.

        Thanks to a DNA test, Avery knows that she's not a Hawthorne by blood,
         but clues pile up hinting at a deeper connection to the family than she had ever imagined. 
         As the mystery grows and the plot thickens, Grayson and Jameson, the enigmatic and magnetic Hawthorne grandsons, 
         continue to pull Avery in different directions. And there are threats lurking around every corner, 
         as adversaries emerge who will stop at nothing to see Avery out of the picture - by any means necessary.</p>

    <p class="book11">To inherit billions, all Avery Kylie Grambs has to do is survive a few more weeks living in Hawthorne House. 
        The paparazzi are dogging her every step. Financial pressures are building. Danger is a fact of life. 
        And the only thing getting Avery through it all is the Hawthorne brothers. 
        Her life is intertwined with theirs. She knows their secrets, and they know her.

        But as the clock ticks down to the moment when Avery will become the richest teenager on the planet,
         trouble arrives in the form of a visitor who needs her help—and whose presence in Hawthorne House could change everything. ž
    It soon becomes clear that there is one last puzzle to solve, 
    and Avery and the Hawthorne brothers are drawn into a dangerous game against an unknown and powerful player.</p>
